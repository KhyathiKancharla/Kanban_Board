# Vue.js Kanban Board Project

## Overview

This project aims to create a robust Kanban board using Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework. The Kanban board will be a visual project management tool that helps teams manage their work in a flexible and efficient manner. Vue.js, with its reactive components and ease of integration, provides an ideal foundation for building an interactive and dynamic Kanban board.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The Kanban board will be designed to work seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience.

- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality:** Users will be able to easily move tasks between different columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done) through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

- **Real-Time Updates:** Leverage Vue.js reactivity to enable real-time updates, ensuring that all team members see the latest changes to the board without manual refresh.

- **Task Details:** Each task card will display key details, such as task name, description, assigned team member, due date, etc., providing a comprehensive overview of the project status.

- **Customization:** Allow users to customize the board by adding, removing, or rearranging columns to match their specific workflow.

## Technologies

- **Vue.js:** A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

- **Vuex:** State management library for Vue.js to manage the application's state in a centralized manner.

- **Drag-and-Drop Library (e.g., vue-draggable):** Integrate a suitable library to facilitate smooth drag-and-drop functionality.
